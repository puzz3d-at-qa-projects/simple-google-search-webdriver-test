# Simple test using Selenium WebDriver

## Task:  
_Create a single test using WD: navigate to the Google search page, search for an image, and verify that an image tab contains images. Add your home task to Git._

## Solution:

Since there are no additional conditions about using PO pattern, BLL, etc., we'll keep it simple.   
Just several lines of code in [GoogleSearchSimpleTest.java](src/test/java/GoogleSearchSimpleTest.java) using **Selenium webdriver, Webdrivermanager, TestNG and Gradle**.

I hadn't had any issues with WebElements availability during running this test, so I didn't use waits.
